# Machine Learning (Shallow) and Data Science

This repository contains some of my work in the field of Shallow Machine Learning.

The notebooks are experiments, courses, kaggle entries, hacks and code ideas from various sources.  These conists of notebooks using python with pandas, numpy and scikit learn.  For most of these notebooks I have used the following sources as my guide:

- [Sebastian Raschka](https://sebastianraschka.com/books.html)
- [Jason Brownlee](https://machinelearningmastery.com)
- [Sebastian Ruder](http://ruder.io/optimizing-gradient-descent/)
- [Ritchie Ng](https://www.ritchieng.com/)
- [Kevin Markham](https://www.youtube.com/user/dataschool)

I run these notebooks on a Windows machine with GeForce 1060 6Gb.
